    "1. Why do we need OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean and readable code\n",
    "- Relates the code to real-world objects\n",
    "- Example: Hospital, inventory, billing, project management \n",
    "    - Classes: patients, doctors and doctors allocated to patients and with necessary properties and methods \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pillars of OOP (A. P.I.E)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction: Show only what's necessary\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Objects act differently under different conditions (user object acts as admin, worker etc)\n",
    "- Ingeritance: Parent-child relationships where child inherit parent's properties\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Hide complexity of code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What's a class and an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class is a blueprint/type for methods and data of different types\n",
    "- Object is an instance of the class, which has the same blueprint but different values for the data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstraction means hide complexity \n",
    "    - Hide the complex implementation of logic and exposing only what's necessary\n",
    "    - Happens in the design phase \n",
    "    - During execution of logic, developer uses encapsulation to implement abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation means show only what's necessary \n",
    "    - Different datasets have different priorities / necessities \n",
    "    - Some datasets have to have be public, like name, address and all \n",
    "    - Some datasets are important but should not be made public like password, ID card numbers\n",
    "    - So we hide sensitive data from public and add our own methods for ways of accessing that data\n",
    "    - Sometimes there are data which should only be used for internal purposes for executing certain logic which shouldn't be made public\n",
    "\n",
    "    That is, abstraction is implemented by encapsulation \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain in inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the pillars of OOP where u can define a parent - child relationship between two classes where the child inherits properites/methods of parent class\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are virtual methods? What is overriding? (virtual keyword)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual keyword helps us to define some logic in the parent class so that it can be overridden appropriately by the child class\n",
    "- Purely virtual function provides no implementation in the parent class, hence forcing the derived/child class to define their own methods\n",
    "- For example: \n",
    "    - a class shape can have a purely virtual function as `area` and then the derived classes such as `circle` or `rectangle` can provide their own properties for defining their own implementation of `area`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What's Polymorphism?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ability of a object to act differently under different conditions\n",
    "- It can't be implemented without inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is method overriding and method overloading? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Method Overloading: \n",
    "    - a same class have same methods with different signatures (like different parameters/datatypes of parameters)\n",
    "- Method Overriding: \n",
    "    - it pops up in a parent child relationship \n",
    "    - the parent class have a virtual function \n",
    "    - the child class has a unique implementation logic defined with the name of the virtual function in parent which replaces the logic defined above, if any\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Runtime and compile time polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- Runtime:\n",
    "    - Dynamic polymorphism\n",
    "    - Implemented by Method Overloading\n",
    "    - Happens in a parent - child relationship and have to use the `virtual` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compile Time: \n",
    "    - Static polymorphism\n",
    "    - Implemented by Method Overloading\n",
    "    - Behaviour is defined during the compilation of code\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Explain Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concept under polymorphism where you can add additional functionalities for operators such as +, -, *, /\n",
