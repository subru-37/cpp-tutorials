    "## System Design Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting the best database\n",
    "\n",
    "- generally don't affect the functional requirement \n",
    "- depends on the non-functional requirements like data structure and scalability requirements\n",
    "- factors affecting the choice\n",
    "    - structure / non-structured data \n",
    "    - query pattern \n",
    "    - scalability \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caching solution \n",
    "- any system design solution would need some kind of caching\n",
    "- you have a key and value: \n",
    "    - key: query pattern or request params\n",
    "    - value: the response of the api call or query result \n",
    "- common caching solutions: `redis(battle-tested)`, `memcached`, `etcd`, `hazelcast`\n",
    "- frontend caching: `Next Js`, `RTK - Query`, `Tanstack Query`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Storage solution \n",
    "- When data is of type images, videos, pdfs huge documents etc\n",
    "- Use blob storage systems like `Amazon S3`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Content Delivery Network?\n",
    "- The network which distributes the file in blob storage to servers across the world\n",
    "- Faster than querying in S3\n",
    "\n",
    "Blob solution example: `S3 + CDN`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Search Engine\n",
    "- For more niche system design questions like E-Commerce, streaming services\n",
    "- provided by `elastic search`, `solr`\n",
    "- powered by `apache lucene`  \n",
    "- Fuzzy Text Search: handling user misspelt words to return correct result nevertheless \n",
    "- Not recommended to use it as a primary data source\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Series Database\n",
    "- A kind of relational database used for metrics monitoring system \n",
    "- append-only write mode\n",
    "- no random fetching of data and no random updation of data\n",
    "- fetching is also time-grouped\n",
    "- solutions are: `OpenTSDB`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytics on transactions \n",
    "- We need a data warehouse: a large database where we can dump all data with some query capability for analytics on transactions\n",
    "- Solutions: `Hadoop`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the Data Structured?\n",
    "    - Yes\n",
    "        - Do we need ACID properties?\n",
    "            - Yes?\n",
    "                - RDBMS: `MySQL`, `Oracle`, `Postgre SQL`\n",
    "                - Payment systems, inventory management systems\n",
    "                - ability for constructing complex queries and store minimum amount of data\n",
    "            - No? \n",
    "                - NoSQL and SQL are fine\n",
    "    - No\n",
    "        - JSON type datasets for catalouging purposes: `Mongo DB`\n",
    "        - In cases of non-relational datasets with absence of complex queries, we can still use `Document DB`, if it doesn't fall i next category\n",
    "        - In case of ever increasing data and finite number of queries based on the almost-infinite data: `Columnar DB` like `Cassandra` and `HBase`.\n",
    "    - If we don't need ACID properties, Relational datasets, or ever-increasing databases, usage of any of these is fine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complex Database Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Amazon has ever increasing number of orders and with the need for ACID properties, so for newer transactions, `Relational DB` is used and later on put on permanant store in `Columnar DB`."
